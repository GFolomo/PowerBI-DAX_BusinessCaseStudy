In this Business Case Study, I am a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. As a BI Consultant, I have been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations and just received the following note from the Business Manager:

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!
Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecing transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportuniies to drive more sales and work more efficiently. 
Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:
1) What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2) How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3) What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?
4) What's our average order value?

Task: Build a single-page dashboard based on the manager's note to help him improve the restaurant's operations.

About the dataset:
This dataset contains 4 tables in CSV format
- The Orders table contains the date & time that all table orders were placed
- The Order Details table contains the different pizzas served with each order in the Orders table, and their quantities
- The Pizzas table contains the size and price for each distinct pizza in the Order Details table, as well as its broader pizza type
- The Pizza Types table contains details on the pizza types in the Pizzas table, including their name as it appears on the menu, the category it falls under, and its list of ingredients
