RECOMMENDATIONS
***************
- Stocks can be managed accordingly 
  a) reducing/preventing waste/overstocking 
  b) preventing understocking which could lead to unhappy customers due to "Out of stock"; therefore increasing reliability
- The staff/shift roster can be drafted accordingly - OPEX reduction (have more workforce only when needed)
- Develop a marketing strategy to sell more Classic pizzas in order to increase sales/revenues given that Classic pizzas are 
the most profitable (accounting for 26.9% of the total revenue) 
- Conduct a survey to comprehend what is happening with the other categories namely; "Supreme" and "Veggie"
- The business could stop making XXL pizzas (accounting for 0.06% (28/49574) of the total number of pizzas made/sold the whole year) and only 
concentrate on the other sizes. 
- It would be interesting to analyze customer complaints and lead time, to see what actionable insights can be drawn
